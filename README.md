# Node Agent

## Overview
The Node Agent is a lightweight Windows service that transforms idle desktop computers into powerful nodes in the GoPine distributed computing network. It runs silently in the background, leveraging unused CPU and RAM resources to process computation jobs.

## Purpose
- Harnesses underutilized computing resources on organizational desktop PCs
- Operates as a background service with minimal impact on user experience
- Processes distributed computing tasks during idle times
- Returns completed job results to the central Job Server

## Key Features
- **Silent Background Operation**: Runs as a Windows service without disrupting normal computer use
- **Resource Management**: Intelligently uses available CPU and RAM while respecting system needs
- **Job Processing**: Handles various job types (OCR, PDF parsing, etc.) using local computing power
- **Secure Communication**: Establishes reliable connections with the central Job Server
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handles connection drops and system shutdowns gracefully

## Technical Details
- **Tech Stack**: Python + PyInstaller
- Windows service implementation for seamless operation
- Asynchronous communication with the Job Server
- Local job processing with configurable resource limits
- Integration with Job Schemas for standardized task definitions
- Automatic updates and health reporting

## Installation & Configuration
The Node Agent is designed for simple deployment across organizational computers, with centralized configuration options for administrators.

## Security Considerations
- Operates with limited permissions for data safety
- Processes only approved job types
- No access to sensitive system resources
- Data transmission encryption for privacy
